## Why This Matters for Your Business

The math on talent has changed. If you're building a company or running a team and you're still thinking about headcount the way you did three years ago, you're bringing a knife to a gunfight.

Here's the old equation: output equals headcount. You needed more engineers to write more code, more analysts to crunch more numbers, more marketers to produce more content. Growth meant hiring. Capability meant team size.

Here's the new equation: AI multiplies talent. One senior engineer with the right tools ships what a team of five did two years ago. One analyst processes what a data team handled. The 10x engineer just became the 100x engineer.

This changes everything—how you hire, how you structure teams, how you think about building a company.

## More Money Than Talent

I talk to founders all the time. The ones raising capital? They're not struggling to find money. They're struggling to find people who can actually get things done.

Capital is abundant. AI is the hottest investment thesis in a generation. Funds are deployed, checks are written, valuations are generous. That side of the equation is solved.

What's scarce is talent that can actually operate in this new environment. People who know how to wield AI, not just talk about it. People who can ship with a small team. People who adapt when the tools change every six months.

The constraint has flipped. Money isn't the bottleneck—people are.

This has real implications. If you're a founder, stop optimizing for runway like capital is what's scarce. It isn't. Start optimizing for talent density. A smaller team of exceptional people will outrun a larger team of average ones every single time, and that gap is only getting wider.

## How We Hire at Quicksilver

We've learned a few things about finding the right people.

Our process includes a code challenge with a live curveball thrown in. You come in prepared, you start working, and then we change something on you. New requirement. Unexpected constraint. Information you didn't have before.

We're not testing what you've memorized. We're testing how you handle it when the ground shifts. How you think on your feet. How you navigate uncertainty without freezing up.

This separates people who can wield AI from people who can only follow playbooks. The playbook followers freeze when conditions change. The AI-native operators adjust, use the tools available, figure it out.

We want people who treat AI as a tool, not a crutch. People who use AI to move faster but can still think when the AI is wrong. People with judgment—because leverage without judgment is dangerous.

## Rent Before You Own

Here's advice I give founders that sounds backwards at first: rent talent before you commit headcount.

Fractional roles. Project-based engagements. Contractors who might become full-time. Call it "rent to own" if you want.

Why? Because hiring mistakes are expensive as hell and hard to undo. A bad full-time hire costs you six months of productivity, team energy, and focus. A bad contractor costs you a project.

More importantly, you learn things by working with people that you can't learn in interviews. How do they handle ambiguity? How do they communicate when things go sideways? Do they actually ship, or do they just talk well?

Some of our best hires started as project engagements. We worked together, liked what we saw, shook hands and made it permanent. That's rent to own.

Stay lean longer than feels comfortable. I know the board wants to see headcount growth. I know investors ask "how big is your team?" like it's a measure of progress. Resist that pressure. A team of six operating at full leverage will run circles around a team of twenty carrying dead weight. And you'll move faster, make decisions quicker, and spend a lot less time in meetings.

## The Reality of Organizational Transformation

This is harder for existing companies than for startups.

If you're a founder building from scratch, you can hire for the new equation from day one. If you're running an established organization, you have a different problem: you're not starting fresh. You have people, processes, org charts, expectations.

You can't just "add AI" to a bloated organization and expect transformation. The technology isn't the hard part. The hard part is that AI changes who does what.

Some roles get more leveraged. Some roles get compressed. Some roles become unnecessary. The analyst who spent 40 hours a week pulling reports might not have 40 hours of work anymore—but they might be perfectly positioned to interpret the reports and make decisions, if they're willing to evolve.

Transformation means rethinking the shape of the organization. Some people will embrace the leverage—they'll do more, have more impact, grow into bigger roles. Some will cling to the old ways, define their value by hours worked or tasks completed, and resist the change.

You can't drag people into the future kicking and screaming. You have to be honest about what's changing and give folks the chance to adapt. Some will. Some won't. That's just the reality of it.

## The Brain Drain Risk

Here's something I'm watching with real concern: big companies slowing AI adoption through process paralysis.

Security reviews. Committee approvals. Pilot programs that never graduate. Legal signoffs that take months. Every stakeholder gets a veto, and nobody is accountable for the cost of delay.

Meanwhile, the best people inside those organizations—the ones who want to move fast, build things, see impact—are getting frustrated. They see the opportunity. They see competitors moving. They're stuck in meetings arguing about acceptable use policies.

This is self-imposed brain drain. The innovators leave for startups, for smaller companies, for anywhere they can actually build. The people who stay are the ones comfortable with the slow pace. The organization gets more conservative over time, exactly when it needs to get more aggressive.

Now look, I want to be fair here: security reviews exist for a reason. You shouldn't hand production data to an unvetted AI tool. You shouldn't deploy customer-facing AI without understanding the risk. Caution has a place.

But pick your spots. Find use cases with the right risk envelope—internal tools, workflow automation, productivity gains, R&D experiments. Places where failure doesn't damage the core business. Start there. Prove value. Build trust. Demonstrate that AI adoption isn't reckless, it's managed.

Then edge further out onto the ledge.

Paralysis isn't safety. It's just a different kind of risk—the risk that your best people walk out the door and your competitors blow right past you.

## The Opportunity

I want to end on a high note, because I genuinely feel optimistic about where we're headed.

This is the most leveraged time in history to be talented. One person can build what teams built before. Small companies can compete with giants. I've been doing this a long time, and the playing field hasn't been this level in decades.

If you're a founder: there's more money in the market than strong talent. Act accordingly. Resist the headcount trap—don't confuse hiring with progress. Rent before you buy, and rent to own when you find the right folks. Stay small, stay senior, stay leveraged.

If you're an operator inside a bigger company: push for speed. Find the safe places to experiment. Build the proof points. Don't let process paralysis steal the opportunity from under your nose.

If you're an individual building your career: your moat isn't what you can do. It's what you can do with AI. Learn the tools. Multiply yourself. The folks who figure this out are going to have options they've never had before.

The talent equation has changed. The people who understand that—and act on it—will build the next generation of great companies.

I'm betting on it.
