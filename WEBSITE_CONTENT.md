## [SYSTEM_INIT]

**Main Headline:**
AI systems that create lasting competitive advantage.

**Tagline:**
Built by PhDs and Fortune 50 veterans. Production-grade. Research-driven.

**CTA:**
Get in touch

---

## [POSITION]

We design and deploy AI systems built to perform—grounded in rigorous engineering.

We chart where your business needs to go—and build the systems that get you there at scale.

## [OUR APPROACH]

### [01] Strategic Systems Design

We help organizations become AI-native—not by adding tools, but by redesigning how your business actually runs better with AI.

In a market flooded with hype, you can't afford ad-hoc efforts. We combine PhD rigor with industry pragmatism—so your AI investment actually delivers. Strategy that stands on solid ground. Potential that converts to lasting advantage.

### [02] What We Build

We develop new approaches and tools that move AI systems engineering forward. We build software that changes how you work today—and won't be obsolete tomorrow. We don't do commodity AI. If you want to build the future, call us.

## [PROCESS]

**Heading:**
How We Work

Two engagement types. Both time-boxed. Both senior-led.

### Strategy Engagements

Strategic sprints with leadership teams—weeks, not months. We find where AI moves the needle. Identify what could go wrong. Prove it's solvable. Own delivery. Train your team to run it without us.

No six-month studies. No slide decks gathering dust. Clear direction from people who've done the work.

### Build Engagements

End-to-end delivery—design, build, launch, and handoff. We own it until you do.

No retainers—just build, document, transfer, and train your team to take it from there.

## [ABOUT]

Quicksilver Labs is an engineering-led AI firm built by PhDs and veterans of Deloitte, ExxonMobil, Volvo, and more. We're researchers and practitioners obsessed with what's next—and how it creates real business value.

Senior talent at every layer, from strategy to code. We believe AI creates durable advantage when it's infrastructure, not novelty. We build systems that work in the real world—where data is messy, regulations are strict, and you need it to last.

We turn AI ambition into working systems.

## [LEADERSHIP]

### Dan Watkins, CEO

PhD in Materials Science. Career spent building and scaling teams that deliver complex systems in production. He operates at the intersection of technical execution and business strategy—leading teams through high growth and operationalizing AI at enterprise scale.

His focus: turning technical capability into business value that lasts. He brings VC experience and knows what scales—and what breaks when you grow too fast.

### Ben Letson, CTO

PhD in Mathematics. Years spent designing and delivering complex AI systems in production. He came up through early-stage teams, scaled systems through hypergrowth, and went on to lead enterprise-scale delivery.

His work lives at the intersection of applied math, engineering, and execution. Career obsession: why AI projects fail in the real world, and how to build systems that don't.
